# Emergency Alert System with Flask and Twilio 🚨
Welcome to our Emergency Alert System project! This project is designed to automatically detect emergency situations from text messages and send alerts via SMS. Utilizing machine learning for text classification, this system can differentiate between emergency and non-emergency messages. 
## Built with Flask, Twilio, and scikit-learn, it's an efficient way to handle potential crises. 🆘

## Features
Automatic Detection: Utilizes a Logistic Regression model to classify text messages as emergency or non-emergency. 🤖
SMS Alerts: Sends SMS alerts for emergency situations using Twilio's API. 📱
Real-time Processing: Integrates with webhooks to process incoming messages in real-time. ⏱️
Data-driven Insights: Leverages a pre-trained model on a clean dataset for accurate emergency detection. 📊
Scalable Architecture: Built with Flask, making it easy to scale and integrate with other services. 📈

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Twilio Account and API Key
Flask

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages.
Set up your Twilio account and get your API keys.
Run the Flask application to start processing messages.

## How It Works
Text Classification: The system uses a trained Logistic Regression model to identify emergency messages.
Alert Mechanism: Upon detecting an emergency, it triggers an SMS alert through Twilio.
Webhook Integration: Set up a webhook to receive messages in real-time and process them through the Flask application.
